# ðŸŽ® â€¢ Zappy

Zappy is Epitech's second-year final project.<br><br>This project **aimed at developing a network game** where multiple **AI teams** compete on a field to gather resources.<br>
The **winning team** is the one that manages to have at least **6 players reaching the maximum level.**

## General Info

Players, represented by AIs, move around a field to gather necessary resources to evolve.<br>
Each player starts at level 1 and must collect specific resources to reach higher levels. The ultimate goal is to have at least 6 team members reaching the maximum level.

Teams need to devise strategies to optimize resource collection and hinder other teams' progress. Communication and coordination among AIs within the same team are crucial to achieving this goal.

## Installation

## Usage
**After installation**, here's how to launch the project
### Server Launch:

```
   ./zappy_server -p [PORT] -x [WIDTH] -y [HEIGHT] -n [TEAMS] -c [NB_CLIENTS] -f [FREQ]

      -p:           Connection port to the server.
      -x & h:       Dimensions of the game map.
      -n:           Names of all the teams.
      -c:           Maximum number of players per team.
      -f:           Execution frequency of the server.
```

### AIs Launch:
```
   ./zappy_ai -p [PORT] -n [TEAM NAME] -h [SERVER HOSTNAME] -i [ID]

      -p:           Connection port to the server.
      -n:           Team name of this AI.
      -h:           IP address for server connection.
      -i:           Client ID. (optional)
```

### GUI Launch:
```
   ./zappy_gui -p [PORT] -h [SERVER HOSTNAME]
