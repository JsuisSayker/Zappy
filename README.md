## General Info

Players, represented by AIs, move around a field to gather necessary resources to evolve.<br>
Each player starts at level 1 and must collect specific resources to reach higher levels. The ultimate goal is to have at least 6 team members reaching the maximum level.

Teams need to devise strategies to optimize resource collection and hinder other teams' progress. Communication and coordination among AIs within the same team are crucial to achieving this goal.

## Project Components

### Server
- **Programming Language:** [**C**](https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/C_(langage))
- **Features:**
  - Manages communication between GUI and AIs
  - Manages resources and field state
  - Synchronizes and manages AI actions

### Artificial Intelligences (AIs)
- **Programming Language:** [**Python 3**](https://docs.python.org/3/)
- **Features:**
  - Resource gathering strategy
  - Autonomous decision-making to reach the maximum level
  - Coordination with other team members

### Graphical Client (GUI)
- **Technology:** [**C++**](https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/C%2B%2B) **&** [**Vulkan**](https://www.vulkan.org/learn)
- **Features:**
